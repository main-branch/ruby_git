# RubyGit Implementation Plan

This is the plan for the RubyGit project, which provides an object-oriented wrapper
around the Git command line. The project follows a clear architecture with three main
objects: Worktree, Index, and Repository.

Implementation of git commands will follow a logical progression to build upon
previous functionality and deliver value early. Here is the order:

## Git commands

**1. Basic Repository Operations (Some Already Implemented)**

* ✅ git init
* ✅ git clone
* ✅ git status
* ✅ git add
* git commit
* git log

**2. Branch Management**

* git branch (create, list, delete)
* git checkout/switch
* git merge
* git rebase

**3. Remote Operations**

* git remote (add, remove, list)
* git fetch
* git pull
* git push

**4. Advanced Repository Operations**

* git tag
* git stash
* git cherry-pick
* git reset
* git revert

**5. Specialized Operations**

* git blame
* git bisect
* git submodule
* git worktree
* git reflog

## Rationale

1. **Start with the basic workflow**: This follows the typical Git workflow that
   developers use daily. You've already implemented init, clone and status, so add
   and commit are the natural next steps to complete the basic functionality.
2. **Branch management**: Once basic repository operations are in place, branch
   management is essential for any Git workflow.
3. **Remote operations**: These commands build on local operations but add networking
   capabilities.
4. **Advanced operations**: These provide more specialized functionality that builds
   on the core commands.
5. **Specialized operations**: These are less commonly used but provide powerful
   capabilities for specific use cases.

This approach allows functional value to be delivered early while building a
foundation for more complex operations. It also aligns with my idea of how users
typically learn and use Git, making the library more intuitive.
